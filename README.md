# CRUD_peration_assignment
Sample Design Overview:

Your provided layout uses basic Bootstrap elements like buttons and forms. Itâ€™s simple and functional, focusing more on working features than looks.
Flexibility in Design:

No strict rules on design. You can change button styles, layouts, colors, or fonts as long as the core functionality (add, edit, delete) works.
Functionality Focus:

Key actions like adding, editing, and deleting products should work properly, ensuring the data updates in the database.
Core Functionalities:
Product Addition:

Users should be able to add a product (name, description, price) and store it in the database.
Product Editing:

Users can modify an existing product and save the changes to the database.
Product Deletion:

Users should confirm deletion, and the product will be removed from the database.
Design Flexibility:
You can:S
Use any design framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, custom CSS).
Play with different layouts like cards, tables, or grids.
Customize buttons, headers, and add tooltips or icons.

Key Considerations:
User Experience: Keep it easy to navigate with clear labels.

Error Handling: Display proper feedback for successful or failed actions.
Responsive Design: Make sure the app works well on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Next Steps:
Design with Creativity: Use the sample as inspiration and expand.

Implement Functionality First: Ensure CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations work correctly.
Polish the Design: After ensuring functionality, refine the UI for a better user experience.
